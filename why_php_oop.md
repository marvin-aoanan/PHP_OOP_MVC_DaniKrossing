# Why learn OOP?
1. Companies want OOP, not Procedural.
2. Better for group work.
3. You can easily re-use code.
4. Better organized code.
5. Better with medium to large websites.

## What you need?
1. Basic Procedural PHP knowledge

What 3 Tasks PHP Does?
1. We query the database and connect to it
2. We handle data submitted by users
3. We show Database data to the user

# Procedural VS OOP
1. All 3 tasks are written/coded in one file while OOP are written/coded these 3 tasks into separate file and have different task categorised into different classes. 

# Design Patterns
## MVC Model
2. Model - Connects to Database
3. View - Show the data to the users using the Model/Controller
4. Controller - Get the data from the users, fetch/update data to the Database using Model class.
